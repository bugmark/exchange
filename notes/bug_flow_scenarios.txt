-- high level description of *intent* around the flow

   1. the prediction market ( or if no ui, just the mapping )
   2. the bug bounty ui ( assume this is separate from the bug tracker )
   3. admin ui ( filling in the conceptually less important gaps )

-- stakeholders
   1. joe - user wants a bug fixed
   2. steve - developer wants $100
   

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIMPLEST SCENARIO
-----------------

Joe navigate to the project and sees a link to a market for that repo.
Joe visits the market for that repo and finds a bug he cares about ( might already have a bug id )
Joe sees that there are no bids on the bug in a) his web3 browser? b) the rails representation of the bug ?

> Just for signing up in the Marketplace, Joe gets 1000 free BugCoin [ future: use bank ach to top-up bugcoin ]
EVENT: 1000 bugcoin signup grant to joe (registration)

Joe decides that he is willing to pay a) $100 b) 100 BugCoin to have the bug fixed in the next two months.
Joe clicks 'bid', is prompted for an amount and a deadline, fills those in, and then says ok.

    ------------------------------------------------------
    RISK #2; he needs to put the money in escrow [ TBD ]
       -> paypal payment link,
       -> etherium address to which he can send the money from coinbase
       -> dapp interface to create the contract and fund it.
       	  <CreateContract BugId DueDate> <BidYes ContactId Amount>

	  riffs:
	  - we keep a balance for the user that gets topped up to x as she consumes site services
	  - if user has no etherium wallet, we can create an internal address for them that we facilitate funding with usd.
	    ( if they lack an etherium wallet, how do they withdraw their funds?  maybe they can't! or we use paypal! )

EVENT: joe offers $100 for fix

Joe has 900 BugCoin and sees the 'Bid' he created in the Market.

Steve visits the market and looks for bugs with bids.
Steve finds Joe's Bid, reads the bug, decides he can fix it. Sees "sign up" button.  Clicks it.

EVENT: 1000 bugcoin signup grant to Steve (registration)

Steve sees Bid with "Accept" button on it.  He clicks it.

EVENT: steve accepts the offer

Steve has 900 BugCoin and sees Joe's Bid and his own Ask and a spinner saying "matching...."
  While the 'matching...' is displayed, steve can cancel his Ask.
(future: reselling stakes flows are enabled for the newly created cross.)

EVENT: system matches joe's bid with steve's ask, creating a new contract.

Steve sees the spinner go away.  He can no longer cancel his Ask. The contract is committed. ( reselling is not MVP, but can be a dummy link )
Joe also sees that his Bid can no longer be cancelled.

Steve fixes the bug and gets an admin to mark it closed.

EVENT: Bug is successfully closed on x date

Joe and Steve both see that the bug is closed, and that the confirmation date is the due date that Joe specified.
  ( future: if Steve wants his money sooner, he can resell his stake now - steve must offer discount for time and risk of reopen bug )
            ( one simple case - Joe tries out the fix and offers to buy out steve 'cause it works )
	    ( business opportunity - validate immature contracts with closed bugs and buy them out at a discount, taking the time / reopening risk )

EVENT: Joe's contract deadline passes and the cross is resolved "Yes".  System awards contents of contract to holders of "yes" stakes.
       (future: transaction fee)

Joe has 900 BugCoin.
Steve has 1100 BugCoin.

[ TBD EVENT: steve withdraws his bugCoin - needs payment method ]

SIMPLE SCENARIO 2 : The maturity date elapses and the bug is not closed.  ( it was not fixed, or the fix was re-opened )
-----------------

EVENT: Joe's contract deadline passes and the the cross is resolved "No". System awards contents of contract to holders of "no" stakes.
       (future: transaction fee)

Joe has 1100 BugCoin.
Steve has 900 BugCoin.


ELABORATIONS
1. transaction fees - lots of options who gets charged, when they get charged
2. external payment options - we sell bugcoin ( troubling if free bugcoin has a secondary market.  paid bugcoin is separate. )

ELABORATION: EXTERNAL PAYMENT METHODS(s)  ( buy and sell bug coin )
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Does Kickstarter take your money before or after the campaign fully funded. Maybe we can de-emphasize "escrow" and "funding the system".
   We might authorize funds to award you virtual bugcoin.

    BugCoinKarma  vs BugCoinGold
   
  ( possible: we might have tons of money in escrow, use the float in the contract to produced revenue in some reasonable low-risk way )


Terminology Ideas
`````````````````
Contracts have a maturity date.
Contracts also have resolution conditions which may met before the date, but may no longer be met at the date.

* payment details
* re-selling marketplace ui
* cross-making engine & new conditions for crosses ( e.g. partial bids aggregate to meet 



SCENARIO : Steve thinks he can fix a bug and wants to get paid 100 BugCoin.  Joe only offers 10, but Sally offers the other 90.

    


SCENARIO : Stakes in the Contract are Re-Sold
